        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "Python is easy to learn because of its simple structure and clear syntax. It's also free and open-source, so anyone can use and modify it. Since Python is interpreted, it runs code line by line, making testing and debugging easier. It’s dynamically typed, meaning you don’t need to declare variable types.\n",
        "Python is object-oriented, allowing tasks to be grouped into objects. It’s portable, so the same code works on different machines. It also has a large standard library with tools for various tasks like image manipulation and databases. Additionally, Python supports GUI programming for building desktop applications.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "Predefined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meaning in the language. They are part of the syntax and cannot be used as variable names. These keywords help in writing code by defining operations such as control flow, loops, exceptions, functions, and more. Here's how some of them are used:\n",

        "Ans:\n",
        "Mutable Objects\n",
        "Definition: Can be changed after creation.\n",
        "In-place Modification: Changes happen in the same object.\n",
        "Example:\n",

        "There are different types of operators:\n",

        "5: Explain the concept of type casting in Python with examples?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "Type Casting: It is also known as type conversion.\n",
        "It is a process of converting 1 data type of a value or an object is called type conversion.\n",
        "There are 2 types of conversions: Implicit, Explicit\n",
        "Implicit Typecasting (also called automatic type conversion) is when Python automatically converts one data type into another without explicit instructions from the programmer. This usually happens when an operation involves different types, and Python ensures compatibility by converting the \"smaller\" type into the \"larger\" type.\n",
        "Eg: a = \"5\"     # String\n",
        "b = 3       # Integer\n",
        "result = int(a) + b  \n",
        "print(result)\n",
        "Explicit Typecasting (also known as type conversion) is when the programmer manually converts one data type into another in Python. This is done using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc. Explicit typecasting is used when you need to convert data types intentionally to avoid errors or to achieve specific results.\n",
        "Eg:\n",
        "Python provides built-in functions for type casting, such as int(), float(), str(), list(), tuple(), dict(), etc.\n",
        "a = \"5\"     # String\n",
        "b = 3       # Integer\n",
